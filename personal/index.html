                <p>My photography skills are honed through a blend of technical and artistic theory, ensuring that every image I capture is of the highest quality. My approach to photography is meticulous, focusing on composition, lighting, and timing to create visually striking and meaningful photos. I expertly use Adobe Software to enhance and perfect each shot, ensuring clarity, color accuracy of all my photos.

                    In capturing the Chicago's iconic structures, I pay close attention to perspectives, highlighting the architectural beauty and grandeur of the city. My goal is to convey not just the physical appearance, but also the essence and character of the structures.
                    <br>
                <br>
                    Through my lens, I strive to immortalize the intricate details and unique attributes of each subject, whether it's the sleek modernity of a skyscraper or the historic charm of a classic building. My photography is a testament to my dedication to quality and my passion for capturing the world in its most beautiful and authentic form.</p>

                <video src="image/Final-horizontal.mp4" controls></video>
                <p>When it comes to video, there are many different things I consider. How it is going to be used and how it is meant to be seen. This example is for the Hirschi Masonry website. I used the provided footage, cleaned it up, and set up the video to showcase the best of the services provided by Hirschi Masonry.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond videos made for major companies, I also work on personal videos showcased in Mentally_Wrong; a personal project of mine to showcase the design and personal experience I have had with various video games. This also influences assets I have made for online video broadcasting using the Adobe software, Stream Labs, and OBS Studio.

                <p>Graphic design is a broad and dynamic field, encompassing a wide range of industries and applications. From branding and advertising to digital media and print, the possibilities are virtually endless. During my time at DW Green Co., I had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, one of which was creating a QR code flyer for a client in California's grocery retail space. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I utilized my skills in Adobe Suite, including Photoshop and Illustrator, to create and refine the design. Attention to detail was crucial, from the alignment and spacing of elements to the choice of fonts and color schemes. The final product not only met the client's expectations but also demonstrated my ability to deliver high-quality, professional designs that effectively communicate the intended message.
